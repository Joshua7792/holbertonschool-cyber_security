Cryptography Basics - SHA-1 Hashing

Description

This repository contains a collection of cryptography-related tasks designed to help understand fundamental cryptographic concepts and their practical implementation. The first task focuses on hashing passwords using the SHA-1 algorithm in a Bash script.

Task 0: SHA-1 Hashing

Objective:

Write a Bash script that hashes a given password using the SHA-1 algorithm and stores the resulting hash in a file.

Requirements:

The script must accept a password as an argument $1.

It must generate an SHA-1 hash of the provided password.

The resulting hash must be stored in a file named 0_hash.txt.
