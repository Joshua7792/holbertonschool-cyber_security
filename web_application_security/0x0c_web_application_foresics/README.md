# Web Application Forensics - Amateur

**Project Directory:** `web_application_security/0x0c_web_application_foresics`

## ðŸ“š Description

This project focuses on Web Application Forensics by analyzing logs from a compromised system. It uses `auth.log` and `dmesg` to determine the attack method, affected user accounts, operating system information, and firewall changes. The goal is to extract actionable intelligence and improve defensive strategies.

## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Define Digital Forensics and Web Application Forensics
- Analyze web application and authentication logs
- Identify compromised accounts and attacker IPs
- Understand firewall rule changes
- Document findings clearly in a forensic report
